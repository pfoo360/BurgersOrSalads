# Technical details

# Goals

- To build the front-end and back-end of a simple application, from reading documentation to final product, in a weekend
- To work with an API that I did not create, in this case the [FourSquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api-overview)
- To experiment with NodeJS and ExpressJS to create a simple REST API
- To work with TailwindCSS for styling and responsive web design
- etc.

# Things that could be improved

- error handling for more edge cases
- better responsive web design and using more media queries to accomodate more screen sizes
- form-handling/data-cleaning in the back-end
- think of a better name for the app
- use less emojis
